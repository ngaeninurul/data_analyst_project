# SHUNYI AQI DASHBOARDâœ¨


## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the Air Quality Index (AQI) data from Shunyi, China (2013-2017). It explores trends, seasonal patterns, and AQI categories (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.). Data visualization is powered by Streamlit, enabling interactive exploration.

## Project Structure

- **all_data.csv**: A cleaned and combined dataset used for analysis.
- **notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis workflow.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages to run the project.
- **url.txt**: Text file containing the URLs or descriptions of data sources.
- **dashboard/dashboard.py**: Python script to generate the interactive dashboard.
- **dashboard/logo.png**: Logo used in the dashboard.
- **data/**: Directory containing individual CSV files for air quality data from various locations.

## Features

1. **Data Analysis**: Explore and analyze air quality trends using `notebook.ipynb`.
2. **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize air quality insights through a dashboard implemented in `dashboard.py`.
